      "1️⃣ In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and Greek yogurt together until no white yogurt streaks remain. The yogurt provides the protein and the acidity needed for a good rise.",
      "2️⃣ Stir in the cinnamon and baking powder. This allows the leavening agent to start working immediately with the yogurt's acidity.",
      "3️⃣ Add the oat flour and stir until a thick batter forms. If the batter seems too dry (oat flour absorbs a lot of moisture), add the almond milk one tablespoon at a time until it's pourable but still thick.",
      "4️⃣ Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add a tiny amount of coconut oil and wipe out the excess with a paper towel for an even golden finish.",
      "5️⃣ Use a 1/4 cup measure to pour the batter onto the skillet. Space them out so they don't touch.",
      "6️⃣ IMPORTANT: Wait until you see bubbles form on the surface and the edges look dry and set. This usually takes 3–4 minutes on low heat.",
      "7️⃣ Flip gently and cook for another 1–2 minutes on the other side until lightly browned.",
      "8️⃣ Serve immediately. Instead of syrup, try topping with fresh berries or a dollop of almond butter for the ultimate clear-skin breakfast."

      "1️⃣ Preheat your oven to its lowest setting, about 300°F (150°C). Granola needs low and slow heat to get crunchy without burning the nuts.",

      "6️⃣ CRITICAL STEP: When the timer goes off, the granola might still feel slightly soft. This is normal! Do not overbake. It will crisp up significantly as it cools.",
      "7️⃣ Remove from the oven and let it cool completely on the tray for at least 30 minutes without touching it. This ensures you get those large, crunchy clusters.",
      "8️⃣ Once cool, break into clusters and store in an airtight glass jar. Enjoy with unsweetened almond milk or sprinkle over sugar-free coconut yogurt."

      "3 cups stone-ground whole wheat flour",

    ],
    "directions": [
      "1️⃣ In a small glass pitcher, combine the warm water and the yeast. Stir once and let it sit for about 10 minutes until a thick foam forms on the surface. This 'blooming' proves your yeast is alive.",
      "2️⃣ In a large wooden or glass mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt. Create a 'well' (a hole) in the center of the flour.",
      "3️⃣ Pour the yeast mixture and the olive oil into the well. Use a wooden spoon to slowly bring the flour from the edges into the center until a shaggy dough forms.",
      "4️⃣ Dust a clean counter with a little flour. Turn the dough out and begin kneading. Push with the heel of your hand, fold, and turn. Do this for at least 10 minutes until the dough is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticks to your hands.",
      "5️⃣ Lightly oil a bowl, place the dough inside, and cover with a damp warm towel. Let it rise in a draft-free spot for 60–90 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.",
      "6️⃣ Gently punch the dough down to release air. Shape it into an oval loaf or place it in a greased loaf pan.",
      "7️⃣ Cover again and let it rise for a second time for 45 minutes. This second rise is crucial for a light, airy loaf.",
      "8️⃣ Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Use a sharp knife to make 3 parallel slashes across the top of the loaf to help it expand.",
      "9️⃣ Bake for 30–35 minutes. When done, the loaf should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.",
      "🔟 Transfer to a wire rack. Wait at least 1 hour before slicing. Slicing too early lets the steam escape, which can lead to a gummy center."
