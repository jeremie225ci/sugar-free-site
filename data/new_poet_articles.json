        "content": "Most traditional cookie recipes rely on brown sugar for moisture and chewiness. However, if you are avoiding refined sugars to prevent acne flare-ups, you need a smarter approach. \n\n### Why skip brown sugar?\nBrown sugar is essentially white sugar with molasses. It has a high glycemic index that can trigger sebum production and worsen hormonal acne. In this recipe, we use a combination of almond flour and a touch of honey or monk fruit to achieve that classic cookie texture.\n\n### Ingredients\n- 2 cups almond flour\n- 1/4 cup coconut oil (solidified)\n- 1/2 cup sugar-free chocolate chips\n- 1 egg\n- 1 tsp vanilla extract\n- 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup alternative\n\n### Instructions\n1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).\n2. Mix the wet ingredients first (egg, oil, honey).\n3. Fold in the almond flour until a dough forms.\n4. Add chocolate chips and chill the dough for 10 minutes.\n5. Scoop onto a baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes.\n\nPair these with our [Sugar-Free Milk Analysis](https://www.sugar-frees.com/food/almond-milk) for a skin-safe treat."

        "content": "Bananas are naturally sweet, making them the perfect base for sugar-free baking. Unlike store-bought banana bread which is essentially cake, this recipe is a nutrient-dense fuel for your skin health.\n\n### Why this is Dermatologist Approved\nConventional banana bread uses up to 1 cup of white sugar. This spikes your blood glucose, leading to glycation—a process where sugar molecules attach to collagen, causing premature aging and acne. Our version keeps the fiber and vitamins while ditching the white stuff.\n\n### Ingredients\n- 3 very ripe bananas\n- 1/3 cup melted coconut oil\n- 1 egg (or flax egg)\n- 1 tsp baking soda\n- 1.5 cups whole grain or almond flour\n- Pinch of salt\n\n### Instructions\n1. Mash the bananas until completely smooth.\n2. Stir in the melted oil and egg.\n3. Add the dry ingredients and mix until just combined.\n4. Pour into a greased loaf pan.\n5. Bake at 350°F (175°C) for 50-60 minutes.\n\nCompare this with the [Sugar Content of Regular Bananas](https://www.sugar-frees.com/food/banana)."
